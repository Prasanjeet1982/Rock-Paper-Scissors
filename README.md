# FastAPI Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the FastAPI Rock-Paper-Scissors Game! This project provides a web API for playing the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
   ```
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. Open a web browser or use an API client (e.g., curl, Postman) to access the Rock-Paper-Scissors game API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- **GET `/`**: Returns a welcome message.

- **POST `/play/{player_choice}`**: Play the Rock-Paper-Scissors game by providing your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) in the URL. The API will return the result of the game.

## Usage

1. Access the welcome message by visiting the root URL: `http://localhost:8000/`.

2. Play the game by making a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/play/{player_choice}`. Replace `{player_choice}` with your choice of rock, paper, or scissors.

3. The API will respond with the result of the game, indicating the player's and computer's choices, along with the outcome (win, lose, or tie).

## Dependencies

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): A modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/): An ASGI server that serves FastAPI applications.

## Docker Support

You can also run the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in a Docker container. See the `Dockerfile` for instructions on how to build and run the container.

Feel free to customize and extend the game as you like. Enjoy playing and coding!
